Ardent Labs' team of entrepreneurs develop business ideas in learning science and technology. The minimum viable product (MVP) of these ideas are quickly developed and tested to get feedback and market validation. Successful MVPs will receive seed funding to fully develop the app. The most promising ones get spun-off as independent companies by the lead entrepreneur(s) from the lab upon receiving venture funding.
